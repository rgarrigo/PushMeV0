# PushMe

PushMe is a collaborative repo to improve life at school.

Got an idea? Push it. I'll tell you if it's okay to do it and share some infos along the way.

Got an objection? Push it. I'll make sure it's taken into account.

## How to push it

Make a pull request with the files you wanna share.

If you got an idea, put the files in "idea/".

If you got an objection, put the files in "objection/".

Don't know how to do a pull request? Follow this:

## What happen after I push it

Your idea will be presenting to all students and to the staff.

If no one has something to say against it, you'll be able to do it. Green light!

## What happen after I push it - Long version

When your idea is pushed, I will read it.

If it's indeed an idea, pushed in the correct directory: congratulations!
Pull request accepted.

After that, I will see if there are existing structures fitting for it. There are many associations, clubs, individual enterprises inside the school. Diversity is already there and I can tell you nearly all of them are welcoming. Just a linking issue, will share with you what I know and find.

Then, 3 things will take place simutanuously:
- Will see if there are typos or infos to add to your description and propose adjustements. You'll need to accept them in order to merge them.
- If it's Thursday 17:42, I will briefly present your idea on discord with the other ones pushed this week and encourage everyone to read it
- I will pitch your idea to the staff and make sure it is acceptable

Next thursday, the results will be annonced:
- OK, you can go do it with confidence, rgarrigo got your back.
- KO, there is a problem somewhere. If you want my help you will need to redo the all process.
