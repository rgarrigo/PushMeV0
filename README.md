# PushMe

PushMe is a collaborative repo to improve life at school.

Got an idea? Push it. I'll check if it's okay to do it and share some infos along the way.

Got an objection or a comment? Push it. I'll make sure it's taken into account.

## How to push it

Make a pull request with the files you wanna share.

If you got an idea, objection or comment, add the files in "idea/", "objection/" or "comment/", respectively.

If it's your first pull request, please send me a message on slack / discord with your github login.

You don't know how to do a pull request? Follow this:

## What happen after I push it

Your idea will be presenting to the students and staff.

If no one has something to say against it, you'll be able to do it. Green light!

## What happen after I push it - Long version

When your idea is pushed, I will read it.

If it's indeed an idea, from an account of a student, pushed in the correct directory: congratulations!
Pull request accepted.

After that, I will see if there are existing structures fitting for it. There are many associations, clubs, individual enterprises within the school. Diversity is already there and I can tell you nearly all of them are welcoming. Just a linking issue. Will share what I know and what I find with you.

Then, 3 things will take place simutanuously:
- If I see typos / infos to add, I'll propose adjustements. You'll need to accept them if you want to merge them.
- At thursday 17:42, on slack / discord, I will briefly present the ideas pushed this week and invite everyone to read the repo for details.
- I will pitch your idea to the staff to make sure it is acceptable.

Next thursday 17:42, results will be annonced:
- OK, you can start it with confidence, rgarrigo got your back.
- KO, I'll present to you the limitations, rgarrigo will not have your back.

## Why would I want to push it

3 reasons:
- Legitimacy. If time or money need to be invested, you got to know if it's worth the cost. Knowing if everyone consents is a good indicator to have.
- Exposure. Eyes of your peers are not yours. Formal and unformal feedbacks will cover the blind spots of your initial idea, making it easier to implement.
- Visibility. People may want to meet and work with you after looking into your post. But to me, the inspiration that your idea will give to students reading it is what's really rewarding.
